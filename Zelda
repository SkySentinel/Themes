Link is the only one who can take down Ganondorf, but he must be careful when the treacherous Koume is around or he'll get struck during the day!

Vaati and his army of minions is trying to take over the Kingdom during this time of crisis. Ghirahim and Demise enter the fray, taking no prisoners and mercilessly destroying anyone in the way!",
